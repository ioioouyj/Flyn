## Write for Fly

We are building a library of example projects, articles, and technical explainers. We'll pay you to help, just head on over to the [project board](https://github.com/superfly/fly/projects/1) and see what's going on.

We're looking for two things:

1. Example applications that demonstrate how to build server applications that run close to users.
2. Articles about the plumbing underneath modern infrastructure

### Example Apps
The best example apps demonstrate interesting problems developers can solve by running apps close to users. These apps should be small in scope and single purpose. They're not meant to be run directly, they're demonstrations of ideas that developers can apply to their own projects.

### Explainer Articles
It is helpful for developers to understand the plumbing underneath their infrastructure. Technical explainers help with this, and should cover some part of internet/hosting infrastructure.
